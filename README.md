# Predicting-Emergency-Department-Mortality-Risk-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository contains the processed datasets and source code for the paper: "Predicting Emergency Department Mortality Risk Using Machine Learning Algorithms." > Due to the sensitive nature of health record data and privacy regulations, the raw initial dataset (Mydf3223) is not hosted publicly. Researchers interested in accessing this data for replication purposes may contact the corresponding author at alexgirmag@gmail.com. Please include a brief description of your research objectives and intended use of the data in your request.
The data processing module (Data_prepa.ipynb code) outputs four primary files for model implementation: X_train_2_8, X_test_2_8, y_train_2_8, and y_test_2_8. These represent the processed features and labels for the training and testing sets, respectively. All machine learning algorithms in this repository are designed to be initialized using these specific subsets to ensure consistency across models.
